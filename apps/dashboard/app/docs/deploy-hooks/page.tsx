                Deploy hooks are unique URLs that, when requested, trigger a
                deployment of your project. They are useful for integrating with
                CI/CD pipelines, webhooks, or any system that needs to
                programmatically deploy your site.

              <p>
                You can trigger a deployment by sending a <code>POST</code>{' '}
                request to your deploy hook URL. For example, using{' '}
                <code>curl</code>:
              </p>
              <pre>
                <code>{`curl -X POST https://webduh.app/api/deploy-hooks/your-hook-id`}</code>
              </pre>
              <p>
                You can also use deploy hooks in CI/CD workflows, such as GitHub
                Actions, to automatically deploy after tests pass or code is
                merged.

                  Treat deploy hook URLs as secretsâ€”anyone with the URL can

                  Use environment variables to store hook URLs in CI/CD

                You can view, rename, or delete deploy hooks from your project
                settings in the dashboard. Deleting a hook immediately disables
                it.
